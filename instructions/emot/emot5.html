    <h3><u>What you should consider</u></h3>
    <p>There can be various ways in which beliefs, attitudes or intentions can be influenced, e.g. they might be changed, enhanced, reinforced (i.e. same attitude but more certain), strengthened, diminished, etc. 
        Persuasion is not just telling someone something he didnâ€™t know before. It's only an attempt to persuade if it's intended to affect his beliefs, attitudes or intentions.
